# Express 5 Upgrade Notes

This document outlines the changes made when upgrading from Express 4 to Express 5.

## Key Changes

1. **Upgraded to Express 5.0.0-beta.1**
   - Express 5 is still in beta as of June 2025, but it's stable enough for production use.

2. **Added Security Middleware**
   - Helmet for security headers
   - CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
   - Cookie Parser for cookie management

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Implemented Express 5's promise-based error handling
   - Added a centralized error handler middleware
   - Created a custom error view

4. **Session Security Improvements**
   - Set `saveUninitialized` to `false` for better privacy
   - Added `sameSite: 'lax'` for cookies to prevent CSRF attacks

5. **Controller Updates**
   - Updated controller functions to pass errors to Express error handler
   - Added NextFunction parameter to all route handlers

## Benefits of Express 5

- Better async/await support
- Improved error handling for promises
- Enhanced routing capabilities
- Performance improvements
- Better TypeScript integration

## Usage Considerations

When working with Express 5, keep these points in mind:

1. Error handling should use the `next(error)` pattern rather than try/catch blocks that directly send responses
2. Use the async middleware pattern for promise-based route handlers
3. Take advantage of the improved routing system
4. Ensure all security middleware is properly configured
